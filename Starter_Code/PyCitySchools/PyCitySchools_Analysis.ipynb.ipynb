    "PyCitySchools Analysis Summary\n",
    "As the Chief Data Scientist for the district, this analysis provided a comprehensive view of school performance across key indicators. By aggregating data at both the district and school level, we identified trends related to school size, budget, and type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Takeaways\n",
    "1. Charter Schools Outperform District Schools\n",
    "Charter schools consistently achieved higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher percentages of students passing both subjects. Despite typically having lower budgets, charter schools had the highest overall passing rates, suggesting that spending alone doesn't determine success.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Smaller Schools Perform Better\n",
    "Schools with fewer than 1,000 students performed significantly better than larger schools:\n",
    "\n",
    "Average math score: 83.8 vs. 77.7\n",
    "\n",
    "% Overall Passing: 89.8% for small schools vs. 58.3% for large schools\n",
    "\n",
    "This may reflect more individualized attention, better teacher-student ratios, or less administrative complexity."
