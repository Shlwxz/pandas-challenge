# PyCitySchools Analysis

This project analyzes student performance data across a fictional school district. As the Chief Data Scientist, the task was to uncover insights into math and reading scores, budget spending, and school performance trends using Python and Pandas.

## Files Included
- `PyCitySchools_Analysis.ipynb` – Main notebook with analysis and trends.
- `Resources/schools_complete.csv` – School info and budgets.
- `Resources/students_complete.csv` – Individual student scores and demographics.

## Key Findings
- **Charter schools** had significantly higher performance across most metrics compared to district schools, despite lower per-student spending.
- **Smaller schools** showed better results in both math and reading, with nearly 90% overall passing rates, compared to ~58% in large schools.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
